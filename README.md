Simple plugin that uses Conque-Shell to run tests from a grails app. To use this
you need to have conque-shell installed beforehand. I recommend using [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen "Pathogen").

If thats the case you can do:
```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/rosenfeld/conque-term.git
git clone https://github.com/hoffoo/vim-grails-console.git
```

You can either run the entire file or the test function under your cursor. 

The defalt behavior of this plugin is to enter insert mode when switching back to it so Conque gets updated.
This way it does not override the g:ConqueTerm_InsertOnEnter. You can disable this with g:GrailsShellInsertOnEnter.
```vim

" Misc Settings - off by default
let g:GrailsShellStartSplit = 1 " set this to open the shell buffer across the bottom in a split
let g:GrailsShellReturnKey = "<esc>"  " remap a key to switch back to previous buffer

" Recommended Conque settings
let g:ConqueTerm_ReadUnfocused = 1 " run while not the selected window
let g:ConqueTerm_CloseOnEnd = 1 " quit grails when done
```
Misc: 
```vim
" Start the grails shell
:StartGrailsConque

" Map to run the whole file - 
:map <leader>t :RunGrailsTestFile<cr>

" Map to run the Test under the cursor -
:map <leader>s :RunSingleGrailsTest<cr>

" You can also run a test by name, making it convenient to map a specific run:
:RunGrailsTest TestName

" another useful command to map is reruning the last test
:ReRunGrailsTest

" You can also override the path to the executable using:
let g:GrailsShellExecutable = "/opt/grails/bin/grails" " default is just grails
```

You can also optionally open a browser frame to show the html output of your tests - 
to do this set

```vim

let g:GrailsTestsOutputChrome = 1
" or
let g:GrailsTestsOutputChromium = 1

" and open the browser with
:StartGrailsTestsBrowser

```
More browsers to come!

- Search upwards if we are in a sub directory of a grails project
